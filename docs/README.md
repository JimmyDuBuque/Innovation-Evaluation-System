# FHEVM Examples - Documentation

Welcome to the FHEVM Examples documentation! This collection demonstrates privacy-preserving smart contract patterns using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

## About FHEVM

FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) enables smart contracts to perform computations on encrypted data without decryption. This preserves privacy while maintaining the transparency and security of blockchain.

## What You'll Learn

These examples demonstrate:

- **Encrypted Data Types**: Working with `euint8`, `euint32`, `ebool`
- **Homomorphic Operations**: Computing on encrypted values
- **Access Control**: Managing permissions with `FHE.allowThis()` and `FHE.allow()`
- **Async Decryption**: Secure result revelation with callbacks
- **Real-World Patterns**: Practical privacy-preserving applications

## Example Categories

### Advanced Examples

Advanced patterns demonstrating complex FHEVM applications with multiple encrypted dimensions, aggregation, and ranking systems.

## Getting Started

Each example includes:
- Complete Solidity smart contract
- Comprehensive test suite
- Detailed explanations of key concepts
- Common pitfalls and anti-patterns
- Security considerations
